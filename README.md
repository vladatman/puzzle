### About the game
This project is a sliding puzzle in a console version. 
Before you can start game, you decide between two sizes (3x3 or 4x4). 
Then, you can put the numbers into the correct order using w (up), s (down), d (right), a (left). 
You can also ask help during the game using 'h' keyboard. 
Finally, if you want to quit before finishing it, just use the 'e' keyboard.

### Extra information
The project would be used KeyInputs however, because of lack of time the group decided to keep the console version. 
The class of the KeyInputs is still there in the project.
